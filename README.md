# ft_transcandance

## üìå Overview

`ft_transcendance` is a a web-based Pong game where you can challenge friends, chat with them in real-time, and be notified of game events in real-time!

On the backend, we‚Äôre using **Django** to handle user authentication, matchmaking and live chat, while in the **frontend**, we focus on implementing responsive design and handling the game‚Äôs real-time rendering, ensuring a smooth and immersive experience across all devices. The game itself is built to be simple but exciting, with real-time chat and notifications made possible by **WebSockets** and **Django channels**.

To keep everything organized and easy to deploy, each part of the project ‚Äî the frontend, backend, database and redis (for channel layer) runs in its own **Docker container**. This makes it easy to scale and maintain as the project grows.
